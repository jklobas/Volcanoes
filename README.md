Tools for analysis of model output from 2D chemical transport model

This software is designed to be used in a python 2.7 interactive session, such as ipython.

Model outputs can be visualized within classes:
(a) viewing contour plots of stratospheric chemicals
![ClO by latitude and pressure](https://github.com/jklobas/Volcanoes/blob/master/figure_1-2.png)
(b) viewing change in ozone column vs different years
![Ozone column relative to year zero, by latitude](https://github.com/jklobas/Volcanoes/blob/master/figure_2-1.png?raw=true)

And models can be visualized between classes using the o3columns module:
(a) gross ozone:
![model ozone at specific latitude](https://github.com/jklobas/Volcanoes/blob/master/figure_1-1.png?raw=true)
(b) % change in ozone:
![percent change vs no perturbation](https://github.com/jklobas/Volcanoes/blob/master/figure_1.png)
